# Introduction

The Yale Center for Research Computing provides support for research computing at Yale University. Our most active area for support is High Performance Computing, however we also support other computational intensive research such as Geo-Spatial Computation and Data Visualization.  In addition, we work with faculty and research groups across disciplines to design and maintain cost-effective computing capabilities.

## Get Help

To best serve the research community, we hold office hours and are also available through a support tracking system.

### In Person

The YCRC is located on the second floor of [160 Saint Ronan Street](/node/4611). Visitor parking is available upon request. There are also [Red, Orange, Blue and Green shuttle stops](http://yale.transloc.com) within a block of our center.

### Email

To submit requests, concerns or questions via email please send to hpc@yale.edu and your communication will be logged directly with our system. An automated response will be sent back with a tracking number. Replies to your communication will be addressed from YCRC Support and will include the tracking number for reference. Any additional communication, as either replies from you or initiated by us, will be tracked in the system and can easily be referenced by the tracking number.

### Web Interface

Alternatively, a [web interface](https://hpc.research.yale.edu/support) is available for both initiating and tracking a request or concern. After navigating to the website, you can select to log a new ticket or track an existing one. After your selection you will be able to login with CAS. If creating a new ticket, a new ticket form will appear where you can log your request or concern. If selecting an existing issue, a list of open items, assigned to you, will appear. Status of your request or concern can be viewed by selecting the tracking number.

If you have any questions or feedback, we would be happy to hear from you.
