# Overview

We use [modules](/node/3769) to manage many of the software packages installed on the Yale clusters. Modules allow you to add or remove different combinations and versions of software to your environment as needed. See [our module guide](/node/3769) for more info. Below are links to recently generated lists of the available software on each cluster:

*   [Grace](/node/15841)
*   [Farnam](/node/15836)
*   [Omega](/node/15846)
*   [Ruddle](/node/15851)

You can run `module avail` to page through all available software once you log in.

You should also feel free to install things for yourself. For Python environments, we especially like [Anaconda Python](/node/14571). You can also bring your own container with [Singularity](/node/16281).

We provide [guides for certain software packages and languages](/node/16962) as well.
