# Cluster Storage

Each research group is provided with storage space for research data on the HPC clusters. The storage is separated into three tiers: home, project, and scratch. You can monitor your storage usage by running the `getquota` command on a cluster.

!!!warning
    The _only_ storage backed up on every cluster is `home`.

## Home

Home storage is a small amount of space to store your scripts, notes, final products (e.g. figures), etc. Home storage is backed up daily.

## Project

In general, project storage is intended to be the primary storage location for HPC research data in active use.

## 60-Day Scratch (`scratch60`)

Use this space to keep intermediate files that can be regenerated/reconstituted if necessary. **Files older than 60 days will be deleted automatically**. This space is not backed up, and you may be asked to delete files younger than 60 days old if this space fills up.

## Other Storage Options

If you or your group finds these quotas don't accommodate your needs, please see the [off-cluster research data storage options](/data).

Contact us at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) about purchasing cluster storage.

## Retrieve Data from Home Backups

Contact us at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) with your netid and the list of files/directories you would like restored.
