## Deployment Procedure



## Style Guide

- In headings, use the base form of a verb instead of the -ing form. E.g "Transfer Data" vs "Transferring Data"
- When referring to software (e.g. Slurm or Conda), capitalize the name of the software. If you are referring to the associated command (e.g. `conda`), place the name in backticks.
- When using code fencing (e.g. ```), specify the langauge after the first set of backticks.
