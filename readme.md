## Deployment Procedure



## Style Guide

- In headings, use the base form of a verb instead of the -ing form. E.g "Transfer Data" vs "Transferring Data"
- When referring to software (e.g. Slurm or Conda), capitalize the name of the software. If you are referring to the associated command (e.g. `conda`), place the name in backticks.
- When using code fencing (e.g. ```), specify the langauge after the first set of backticks.  
- filenames for pages should have dashes, no underscores, for whitespace
- Headings should be title case
- When specifying gigabytes/gybibytes, just use the first letter (e.g. G or T), to avoid confusing between the two. A description of our convention is described in storage documentation pages.
